# {Title} Specification

## Summary

<!-- 1-3 sentences. A reader who stops here should understand WHAT this does and WHY. -->

## Problem

<!-- What's broken, missing, or suboptimal? Include evidence — references to code, user reports, or agent behavior. -->

## Solution

<!-- The proposed change. Structure with subsections as needed. For SKILL.md changes, show before/after diffs. For new systems, describe components and their interactions. -->

## Constraints

<!-- Non-negotiable rules, boundaries, or invariants. Numbered list. -->

## Out of Scope

<!-- What this spec explicitly does NOT cover. Prevents scope creep during implementation. -->

## Files to Modify

<!-- Table or list of files changed, with brief description of each change. -->

| File | Change |
|------|--------|

## Success Criteria

<!-- Numbered, testable statements. Each criterion should be verifiable by a human or automated test. -->
