## Shared Principles

These principles apply to **every agent on every team**. They are included in every spawn prompt.

### CRITICAL — Non-Negotiable

1. **No agent proceeds past planning without Skeptic sign-off.** The Skeptic must explicitly approve plans before implementation begins. If the Skeptic has not approved, the work is blocked.
2. **Communicate constantly via the `SendMessage` tool** (`type: "message"` for direct messages, `type: "broadcast"` for team-wide). Never assume another agent knows your status. When you complete a task, discover a blocker, change an approach, or need input — message immediately.
3. **No assumptions.** If you don't know something, ask. Message a teammate, message the lead, or research it. Never guess at requirements, API contracts, data shapes, or business rules.

### IMPORTANT — High-Value Practices

4. **Minimal, clean solutions.** Write the least code that correctly solves the problem. Prefer framework-provided tools over custom implementations — follow the conventions of the project's framework and language. Every line of code is a liability.
5. **TDD by default.** Write the test first. Write the minimum code to pass it. Refactor. This is not optional for implementation agents.
6. **SOLID and DRY.** Single responsibility. Open for extension, closed for modification. Depend on abstractions. Don't repeat yourself. These aren't aspirational — they're required.
7. **Unit tests with mocks preferred.** Design backend code to be testable with mocks and avoid database overhead. Use feature/integration tests only where database interaction is the thing being tested or where they prevent regressions that unit tests cannot catch.

### ESSENTIAL — Quality Standards

8. **Contracts are sacred.** When a backend engineer and frontend engineer agree on an API contract (request shape, response shape, status codes, error format), that contract is documented and neither side deviates without explicit renegotiation and Skeptic approval.
9. **Document decisions, not just code.** When you make a non-obvious choice, write a brief note explaining why. ADRs for architecture. Inline comments for tricky logic. Spec annotations for requirement interpretations.
10. **Delegate mode for leads.** Team leads coordinate, review, and synthesize. They do not implement. If you are a team lead, use delegate mode — your job is orchestration, not execution.

### NICE-TO-HAVE — When Feasible

11. **Progressive disclosure in specs.** Start with a one-paragraph summary, then expand into details. Readers should be able to stop reading at any depth and still have a useful understanding.
12. **Use Sonnet for execution agents, Opus for reasoning agents.** Researchers, architects, and skeptics benefit from deeper reasoning (Opus). Engineers executing well-defined specs can use Sonnet for cost efficiency.
