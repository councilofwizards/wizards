## Communication Protocol

All agents follow these communication rules. This is the lifeblood of the team.

> **Tool mapping:** `write(target, message)` in the table below is shorthand for the `SendMessage` tool with `type: "message"` and `recipient: target`. `broadcast(message)` maps to `SendMessage` with `type: "broadcast"`.

### When to Message

| Event | Action | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Task started | `write(lead, "Starting task #N: [brief]")` | Team lead |
| Task completed | `write(lead, "Completed task #N. Summary: [brief]")` | Team lead |
| Blocker encountered | `write(lead, "BLOCKED on #N: [reason]. Need: [what]")` | Team lead |
| API contract proposed | `write(counterpart, "CONTRACT PROPOSAL: [details]")` | Counterpart agent |
| API contract accepted | `write(proposer, "CONTRACT ACCEPTED: [ref]")` | Proposing agent |
| API contract changed | `write(all affected, "CONTRACT CHANGE: [before] → [after]. Reason: [why]")` | All affected agents |
| Plan ready for review | `write(product-skeptic, "PLAN REVIEW REQUEST: [details or file path]")` | Product Skeptic |
| Plan approved | `write(requester, "PLAN APPROVED: [ref]")` | Requesting agent |
| Plan rejected | `write(requester, "PLAN REJECTED: [reasons]. Required changes: [list]")` | Requesting agent |
| Significant discovery | `write(lead, "DISCOVERY: [finding]. Impact: [assessment]")` | Team lead |
| Need input from peer | `write(peer, "QUESTION for [name]: [question]")` | Specific peer |

### Message Format

Keep messages structured so they can be parsed quickly by context-constrained agents:

```
[TYPE]: [BRIEF_SUBJECT]
Details: [1-3 sentences max]
Action needed: [yes/no, and what]
Blocking: [task number if applicable]
```
